            "Project_Description":"This project proposes an innovative solution for urban food production using sustainable farming methods in small spaces, such as rooftops or community gardens. The system will integrate hydroponics or vertical farming techniques, utilizing sensors and automated systems for monitoring soil moisture, temperature, light, and nutrient levels. The goal is to increase the efficiency of food production in urban environments while minimizing the use of water, space, and energy. The project will involve research into sustainable agriculture practices, hardware design for sensors, and software for system control and monitoring",
